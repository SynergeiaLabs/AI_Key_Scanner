# AI API Key Scanner – Prevent OpenAI, Anthropic & Google AI Key Leaks in GitHub PRs

A GitHub Action that **prevents leaked AI API keys before merge**.

AI API Key Scanner scans **pull request diffs** for exposed **OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI API keys**, adds inline GitHub annotations, comments on the PR with a clear summary, and **fails the workflow to block merging** when a key is detected.

The scan runs **before code is merged**, stopping leaks at the earliest possible point in the development workflow.

This is a focused, low-noise guardrail designed specifically for teams using AI APIs.

---

## Why This Exists

AI API keys are frequently copied into scripts, tests, and examples during development.  
One accidental commit can lead to:

- unexpected API charges  
- emergency key rotation  
- security incidents  
- broken trust with customers or auditors  

This action acts as a **preventive control** — it stops AI API keys from ever reaching `main`, not after the damage is done.

---

## Features

- 🔍 Scans **PR diffs only** (added lines, not entire repositories)
- 🔐 Detects **OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI** API keys
- 📝 Adds **inline GitHub annotations** with file and line number
- 💬 Posts a **clear PR comment summary**
- ❌ **Fails the workflow** to block merging when keys are found
- ⚙️ Configurable ignore paths and allowlist regex patterns
- 🚀 Built with **TypeScript** and **Node.js 20**
- 🧠 Designed to be **low-noise and deterministic**

---

## Supported Key Types

- **OpenAI**  
  `sk-...` or `sk-proj-...`

- **Anthropic**  
  `sk-ant-...`

- **Google AI / Gemini / Vertex**  
  `AIza...`

> The scanner is intentionally opinionated and focused on AI providers.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Add the following workflow to your repository:

```yaml
name: AI Key Scanner

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run AI API Key Scanner
        uses: SynergeiaLabs/AI_Key_Scanner@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's it.  
Every pull request will now be scanned **before merge**.

---

## Configuration (Optional)

Create a `.github/ai-key-scanner.yml` file to customize behavior:

```yaml
# Paths to ignore when scanning
# Uses simple substring matching (not glob patterns)
ignorePaths:
  - node_modules/
  - dist/
  - build/

# Regular expressions to allowlist certain key patterns
# Keys matching ANY of these regexes will be ignored
allowlistRegex:
  - "^test-.*"
  - "^example-.*"
```

### Configuration Options

| Option           | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ignorePaths`    | Array of **path substrings** to exclude from scanning (simple substring match, not glob patterns) |
| `allowlistRegex` | Array of regex patterns; matching keys are ignored                                                |

## How It Works

1. Action triggers on `pull_request`
2. Fetches PR file diffs via GitHub API
3. Parses diffs and extracts **added lines only**
4. Scans each line for AI API key patterns
5. Applies ignore and allowlist rules
6. Adds inline annotations for each finding
7. Posts a PR summary comment
8. Fails the workflow to block merge if keys are found

Large diffs without patch data are skipped with a warning to avoid false confidence.

---

## Security Notes

* **Never commit real API keys**, even in tests or examples
* Treat detected keys as compromised and rotate immediately
* This action scans **PR diffs only**, not the full codebase
* Pair with branch protection rules for best results

---

## Pricing

* **Free** for public repositories
* **Paid** for private repositories (via GitHub Marketplace)

GitHub handles billing and access automatically.

---

## Why Not Use a Generic Secret Scanner?

Generic secret scanners are powerful, but often:

* noisy
* over-configured
* focused on all credentials, not AI usage

This action is intentionally narrow:

> **One job: stop AI API keys from reaching `main`.**
